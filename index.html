<h1>  QUANTUM MECHANICS  </h1>




<p>  Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics relating to the very small.
 
It results in what may appear to be some very strange conclusions about the 
physical world. At the scale of atoms and electrons, many of the equations of 
classical mechanics, which describe how things move at everyday sizes and speeds,
 specific time. However, in quantum mechanics, objects instead exist in a haze of probability; they 
have a certain chance of being at point A, another chance of being at point B and so on.  


<h2>  THREE REVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPALS  </h2>


<p>   Quantum mechanics (QM) developed over many decades, beginning as a set of controversial

 mathematical explanations of experiments that the math of classical mechanics could not explain.
 It began at the turn of the 20th century, around the same time that Albert Einstein published his theory 
of relativity, a separate mathematical revolution in physics that describes the motion of things at high speeds.
 Unlike relativity, however, the origins of QM cannot be attributed to any one scientist. Rather,
 multiple scientists contributed to a foundation of three revolutionary principles that gradually
 gained acceptance and experimental verification between 1900 and 1930. They are:

Quantized properties: Certain properties, such as position, speed and color, can sometimes 
only occur in specific, set amounts, much like a dial that "clicks" from number to number. 
This challenged a fundamental assumption of classical mechanics, which said that such properties
 should exist on a smooth, continuous spectrum. To describe the idea that some properties "clicked"
 like a dial with specific settings, scientists coined the word "quantized."

Particles of light: Light can sometimes behave as a particle. This was initially met with harsh criticism, 
as it ran contrary to 200 years of experiments showing that light behaved as a wave; much like ripples on the 
surface of a calm lake. Light behaves similarly in that it bounces off walls and bends around corners, and that
 the crests and troughs of the wave can add up or cancel out. Added wave crests result in brighter light, while waves
 that cancel out produce darkness. A light source can be thought of as a ball on a stick being rhythmically dipped in the
 center of a lake. The color emitted corresponds to the distance between the crests, which is determined by the speed of
 the ball's rhythm. 
Waves of matter: Matter can also behave as a wave. This ran counter to the roughly 30 years of experiments showing 
that matter (such as electrons) exists as particles.



<h3>   PARTICLES OF LIGHT   <h3>



<p>   In 1905, Einstein published a paper, 
"Concerning an Heuristic Point of View Toward the Emission and Transformation of Light,
" in which he envisioned light traveling not as a wave, but as some manner of "energy quanta." This packet of energy, 
Einstein suggested, could "be absorbed or generated only as a whole," specifically when an atom "jumps" between
 quantized vibration rates. This would also apply, as would be shown a few years later, when an electron "jumps" between 
quantized orbits. Under this model, Einstein's "energy quanta" contained the energy difference of the jump; when divided by Planckâ€™s
 constant, that energy difference determined the color of light carried by those quanta.
